'''
problem 01:
You have the following string:

text = "eeeeE llllll lllzzZzzzz eroe operationr pollo"


You need to find all the last letters from each group of letters before a space â€” plus the last letter of the entire text (as shown in the example image).

In other words, you want to extract every letter that comes right before a space or the end of the string.

'''
import re

text = "eeeeE llllll lllzzZzzzz eroe operationr pollo"

pattern = r"([A-Za-z])(?=\s|$)"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)
